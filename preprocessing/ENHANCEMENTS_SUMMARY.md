# Preprocessing Enhancements Summary

## Overview
This document describes the two major enhancements added to the preprocessing pipeline to improve data collection automation and quality.

## Enhancement 1: State-Specific Election Results Scrapers

### What Was Added
- **File**: `11_download_election_results.py` (enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Automated scraping of 2024 Presidential election results for AR, MD, and RI
- **Documentation**: `ELECTION_RESULTS_SETUP.md`

### Implementation Details

#### Arkansas Scraper
- **Source**: `results.enr.clarityelections.com/AR`
- **Method**: HTML scraping + ZIP file extraction
- **Data Format**: Excel files with county-level results
- **Processing**: Aggregates votes by party, calculates percentages and margins

#### Maryland Scraper
- **Source**: `elections.maryland.gov`
- **Method**: Direct CSV download
- **Data Format**: CSV with county, candidate, party, votes
- **Processing**: Filters for Presidential race, aggregates by county/party

#### Rhode Island Scraper
- **Source**: `results.enr.clarityelections.com/RI`
- **Method**: HTML scraping + ZIP file extraction
- **Data Format**: Excel with municipality-level results
- **Special Handling**: Maps towns to 5 RI counties using built-in mapping

### Database Schema

```javascript
{
  "stateFips": "05",
  "stateAbbr": "AR",
  "county": "Pulaski County",
  "electionYear": 2024,
  "electionType": "Presidential",
  "results": {
    "Republican": {"votes": 89542, "percentage": 45.23},
    "Democratic": {"votes": 102341, "percentage": 51.68},
    "Other": {"votes": 6117, "percentage": 3.09},
    "totalVotes": 198000
  },
  "dominantParty": "Democratic",
  "marginOfVictory": 6.45
}
```

### Current Status
⚠️ **Bot Detection Active**: All three scrapers encounter 403/404 errors due to anti-scraping measures.

**Workarounds Available:**
1. Manual download (see `ELECTION_RESULTS_SETUP.md`)
2. Selenium-based automation (requires ChromeDriver)
3. Wait for official data releases (30-60 days post-election)
4. Use third-party aggregators (MIT Election Lab, AP)

### Usage

```bash
# Automatic (will try to scrape, may fail)
python 11_download_election_results.py

# Manual (place CSV files in cache/election_results/)
cp ar_results_2024.csv cache/election_results/
cp md_results_2024.csv cache/election_results/
cp ri_results_2024.csv cache/election_results/
python 11_download_election_results.py
```

### Integration with Pipeline
- ✅ Automatically called by `run_all_preprocessing.sh`
- ✅ Handles failures gracefully (warns, doesn't crash)
- ✅ Supports both automated scraping and manual CSV imports
- ✅ Includes duplicate detection and smart upserts

## Enhancement 2: Verified Voting Equipment Scraper

### What Was Added
- **File**: `06b_scrape_verified_voting.py` (new)
- **Purpose**: Collect detailed voting equipment specifications to enhance quality scores
- **Documentation**: `VERIFIED_VOTING_SETUP.md`

### Why This Matters

**Before Enhancement:**
- Equipment data from EAVS only includes basic flags (has DRE, has optical scan)
- Quality scores limited to 0.2-0.4 range (Poor)
- No information on equipment age, certification, or security

**After Enhancement:**
- Detailed make/model/year data for each county
- Quality scores can reach 0.8-1.0 range (Excellent)
- Age-based scoring (flag equipment 10+ years old)
- OS security assessment (flag Windows XP/7)
- Certification status (EAC certified vs. uncertified)

### Implementation Details

#### Scraping Strategy
1. **HTML Table Parsing**: Extract equipment from static tables
2. **JSON Data Extraction**: Parse embedded JavaScript data
3. **Text Pattern Matching**: Identify equipment from descriptions
4. **Multi-source Fallback**: Try multiple extraction methods

#### Data Collected
```python
{
  'stateAbbr': 'AR',
  'county': 'Pulaski County',
  'manufacturer': 'ES&S',
  'model': 'DS200',
  'technologyType': 'Optical Scan',
  'purchaseYear': 2016,
  'operatingSystem': 'Embedded Linux',
  'certificationStatus': 'EAC Certified',
  'dataSource': 'VerifiedVoting.org',
  'scrapedAt': '2025-10-29'
}
```

#### Enhanced Quality Scoring

**Scoring Formula:**
```python
quality_score = (
    technology_score * 0.25 +      # Modern tech types (Optical Scan, BMD)
    age_score * 0.30 +              # Newer = better (penalize 10+ years)
    certification_score * 0.25 +    # EAC certified preferred
    os_security_score * 0.20        # Secure, updated OS
)
```

**Age Scoring:**
- 0-5 years: 1.0 (Excellent)
- 5-10 years: 0.7-0.9 (Good)
- 10-15 years: 0.4-0.6 (Fair)
- 15+ years: 0.0-0.3 (Poor/Critical)

**OS Security:**
- Windows XP/Vista/7: 0.0 (Critical - unsupported)
- Windows 8/8.1: 0.3 (Poor - near end-of-life)
- Windows 10: 0.7 (Good)
- Windows 11: 0.9 (Excellent)
- Embedded Linux: 0.9 (Excellent - purpose-built)

### Current Status
⚠️ **Dynamic Content Challenge**: Verified Voting uses JavaScript rendering, making simple HTTP scraping ineffective.

**Recommended Approaches:**
1. **Selenium**: Full browser automation (best results, more complex)
2. **Manual Export**: Copy data from website to CSV (fastest for small datasets)
3. **API Request**: Contact Verified Voting for data export (best for bulk)

### Usage

```bash
# Automatic attempt (may return 0 records due to dynamic content)
python 06b_scrape_verified_voting.py

# Manual import (recommended)
# 1. Create CSV: cache/equipment/equipment_data.csv
# 2. Run import script (see VERIFIED_VOTING_SETUP.md)
# 3. Recalculate quality scores
python 06_calculate_equipment_quality.py
```

### Integration with Pipeline
- ⚠️ **NOT auto-run** by `run_all_preprocessing.sh` (too slow, often fails)
- ✅ Can be run manually when needed
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if no detailed data available
- ✅ Works with basic EAVS equipment flags as minimum viable data

---

## USPS API Key Question

### Answer: Currently Unused (Optional Feature)

**Where It's Implemented:**
- `08_automated_voter_analysis.py` - USPS address validation

**Why It's Not Active:**
```python
voter_count = db.count_documents('voterRegistration')
if voter_count == 0:
    logger.info("No voter registration records found")
    logger.info("Skipping address validation (nothing to validate)")
    return  # Script exits here
```

**When It Would Be Used:**
If you obtain voter registration data (currently unavailable for AR/RI/MD), the script would:
1. Validate each voter address using USPS API
2. Standardize address formatting
3. Flag undeliverable addresses
4. Correct typos and errors
5. Mark addresses with delivery point validation (DPV) status

**Setup (if you get voter data):**
```json
{
  "apiKeys": {
    "uspsConsumerKey": "your_key_here",
    "uspsConsumerSecret": "your_secret_here"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improved geocoding accuracy (Prepro-9)
- Data quality enhancement
- Invalid address detection

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Implementation complete and tested
- ✅ Automatically skips when no voter data
- ✅ Ready to use if voter data becomes available
- ⚠️ Not currently needed for AR/MD/RI (no public voter files)

---

## Testing the Enhancements

### Quick Test (All Features)

```bash
# Full pipeline run (includes enhanced scrapers)
./run_all_preprocessing.sh

# Check what was collected
python validate_preprocessing.py
```

### Individual Testing

```bash
# Test election results scraper
python 11_download_election_results.py

# Test equipment scraper
python 06b_scrape_verified_voting.py

# Test USPS validation (will skip if no voter data)
python 08_automated_voter_analysis.py
```

### Expected Outcomes

**Election Results:**
- If scraping works: 104 county results (75 AR + 24 MD + 5 RI)
- If blocked: 0 results with warning messages pointing to manual process

**Equipment Data:**
- With scraper: 0-166 detailed equipment records (depends on dynamic content access)
- Without scraper: 166 basic records from EAVS with limited quality scoring

**USPS Validation:**
- With voter data: Address validation for up to 5,000 voters
- Without voter data: Silent skip with informative message

---

## Production Recommendations

### For Full Automation
1. **Election Results**: Implement Selenium scrapers or wait for official data releases
2. **Equipment Data**: Contact Verified Voting for bulk export or use Selenium
3. **USPS Validation**: Only needed if voter registration data obtained

### For Current Development
1. ✅ **Use What Works**: Basic equipment flags from EAVS
2. ✅ **Manual Supplements**: Add election results manually as needed
3. ✅ **Accept Limitations**: Quality scores may be lower without detailed equipment specs

### For Future Enhancement
1. **Selenium Integration**: Full browser automation for dynamic content
2. **API Partnerships**: Contact data providers for official access
3. **Scheduled Updates**: Run scrapers monthly to catch new data releases
