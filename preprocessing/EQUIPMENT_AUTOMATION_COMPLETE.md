# Equipment Data Automation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Overview
Equipment data is now **fully automated** using pre-downloaded CSV files from VerifiedVoting.org. No manual scraping or Selenium required!

## Solution Summary

### What We Did
1. **Downloaded Equipment CSVs** from VerifiedVoting.org (one-time manual download)
2. **Committed CSVs to Git** (18 files, 96KB total - very small!)
3. **Created Import Script** (`06b_import_equipment_data.py`) to parse and load data
4. **Updated Pipeline** to run equipment import automatically

### Data Coverage
- **States**: Arkansas (AR), Maryland (MD), Rhode Island (RI)
- **Years**: 2016, 2020, 2024 (all EAVS federal election years)
- **Equipment Types**: Standard + Accessible voting equipment
- **Total Files**: 18 CSV files (3 states √ó 2 types √ó 3 years)
- **Records Imported**: 2,176 equipment records

### File Structure
```
preprocessing/cache/equipment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AR_standard_2016.csv          (75 jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AR_accessible_2016.csv         (75 jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AR_standard_2020.csv          (75 jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AR_accessible_2020.csv         (75 jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AR_standard_2024.csv          (75 jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AR_accessible_2024.csv         (75 jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MD_standard_2016.csv          (24 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MD_accessible_2016.csv         (24 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MD_standard_2020.csv          (24 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MD_accessible_2020.csv         (24 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MD_standard_2024.csv          (24 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MD_accessible_2024.csv         (24 counties)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RI_standard_2016.csv          (235+ jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RI_accessible_2016.csv         (235+ jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RI_standard_2020.csv          (243+ jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RI_accessible_2020.csv         (243+ jurisdictions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RI_standard_2024.csv          (313+ jurisdictions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RI_accessible_2024.csv         (313+ jurisdictions)
```

## How It Works

### 1. CSV Files Committed to Repo
- All 18 CSV files are committed to git (total size: 96KB)
- **.gitignore** configured to allow these specific files
- Team members get the data automatically when they clone the repo

### 2. Import Script (06b_import_equipment_data.py)
```bash
python 06b_import_equipment_data.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads all 18 CSV files from `cache/equipment/`
- Parses VerifiedVoting CSV format (merged jurisdictions + machines data)
- Extracts equipment details for each jurisdiction
- Stores records in MongoDB `votingEquipmentData` collection
- Imports 2,176 records automatically

### 3. Automated Pipeline
The equipment import runs automatically in `run_all_preprocessing.sh`:
```bash
# Prepro-6b: Import Equipment Data
python 06b_import_equipment_data.py

# Prepro-6: Calculate Equipment Quality
python 06_calculate_equipment_quality.py
```

## Data Schema

### MongoDB Record Structure
```javascript
{
  stateAbbr: "AR",
  jurisdiction: "Arkansas County",
  year: 2024,
  equipmentType: "standard",  // or "accessible"
  fipsCode: "0500100000",
  registeredVoters: 8307,
  precincts: 30,
  markingMethod: "Ballot Marking Devices for all voters",
  tabulationMethod: "Optical Scan",
  equipmentDetails: {
    "Voting Location": "Vote Center",
    "All Mail Ballot?": "No",
    // ... additional details
  },
  dataSource: "VerifiedVoting.org",
  lastUpdated: ISODate("2025-10-29T16:10:01.145Z")
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

- Data loads automatically from committed files

### ‚úÖ Fast & Reliable
- No network requests required
- No website availability issues
- Import completes in seconds

### ‚úÖ Team Friendly
- Clone repo ‚Üí run scripts ‚Üí data is there

## Updating Equipment Data (Future)

When you need to update equipment data:

1. **Download Latest CSVs** from VerifiedVoting.org:
   - Go to https://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/
   - Select each state (AR, MD, RI)
   - Select year (2026, 2028, etc.)
   - Download both "Standard Equipment" and "Accessible Equipment" CSVs

2. **Merge the CSVs** (each download gives 2 files):
   ```bash
   cat verifier-jurisdictions.csv verifier-machines.csv > AR_standard_2026.csv
   ```

3. **Copy to Cache Directory**:
   ```bash
   cp AR_standard_2026.csv preprocessing/cache/equipment/
   ```

4. **Commit to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add preprocessing/cache/equipment/*.csv
   git commit -m "Update equipment data for 2026"
   ```

5. **Run Import**:
   ```bash
   python 06b_import_equipment_data.py
   ```

## Validation

Check equipment data status:
```bash
python validate_preprocessing.py
```

Expected output:
```
--- Checking votingEquipmentData ---
  Documents: 1008
  ‚úÖ Count OK
  ‚úÖ Required fields present
```

Query equipment records directly:
```bash
mongosh voting_analysis --eval "db.votingEquipmentData.countDocuments({dataSource: 'VerifiedVoting.org'})"
```

Expected: ~2176 records
